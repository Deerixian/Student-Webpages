## Personal Portfolio - Dominik L.

### Who I Am

My name is Dominik L, and as of right now, I am a student in AP Computer Science Principlies. Over the course of the year, I have learned several different key concepts and fundamentals in this class.

### What I've Learned

The concepts I have learned involve coding languages such as C++ and JavaScript. In addition to this, I have also learned CSS and HTMl as well. The projects that I have worked on would not be possible without these concepts I have learned.

### Overview

This portfolio will showcase the various projects that I made during my time in this class, as well as give some more background on myself.
